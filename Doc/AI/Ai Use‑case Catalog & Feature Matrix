# AI Use‑Case Catalog & Feature Matrix (Role / Tenant / Profile)

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines **what AI use‑cases exist**, **who can use them**, **under what conditions**, and **how they are governed** across tenants, roles, and audience profiles. It prevents unstructured AI feature growth and ensures every AI capability is **intentional, measurable, safe, and configurable**.

This document acts as the **single source of truth** for deciding:

* which AI features may be built
* where they appear in the app
* who can access them
* how they are validated and controlled

---

## 2. Core Dimensions

Every AI feature is evaluated across four dimensions:

1. **Use‑Case Category** – what problem AI solves
2. **Role** – student / parent / coach / admin
3. **Audience Profile** – kid / teen / adult / coaching
4. **Tenant Configuration** – enabled, restricted, or disabled

No AI feature may bypass this matrix.

---

## 6. Tenant‑Level Controls

Each tenant can:

* enable/disable features globally
* restrict features by role or profile
* set usage limits and budgets
* require approvals for sensitive features

Tenant rules override defaults but cannot violate safety guides.

---

## 7. Feature Lifecycle

Every AI feature must follow:

1. Proposal (use‑case + value)
2. Matrix validation (role/profile/tenant)
3. Safety & quality review
4. Studio configuration
5. Limited rollout
6. Measurement & iteration

---

## 8. Measurement & KPIs

Each feature must define:

* primary value metric
* safety/refusal rates
* automation success rate (if applicable)
* cost per use

Features without metrics may not advance.

---

## 9. Enforcement

Enforced by:

* Platform Studio (configuration & validation)
* AI & Automation Gateway (runtime checks)
* Widget registry (feature availability)

Violations trigger fallback or disablement.

---

## 10. Non‑Negotiables

* No feature ships without a defined use‑case
* No feature bypasses the matrix
* No tenant can override child safety
* No automation without visibility

---

This guide ensures AI remains **purposeful, controlled, and scalable** across the platform.
