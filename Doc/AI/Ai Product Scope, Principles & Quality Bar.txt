# AI Product Scope, Principles & Quality Bar

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines **what AI is allowed to do**, **what it must never do**, and the **quality bar** AI features must meet before being exposed to users. It ensures AI enhances the product without compromising **safety, trust, pedagogy, or platform stability**.

This document is **product‑level governance**, not an implementation spec, and must be referenced by all AI, automation, MCP, and connector features.

---

## 2. In-Scope AI Capabilities

AI in the platform is intended to **assist, not replace** human learning, coaching, or decision-making.

### 2.1 Allowed Core Capabilities

* Conversational assistance (chat, Q&A, explanations)
* Content summarization (classes, meetings, notes, progress)
* Guided learning support (hints, step-by-step help, practice feedback)
* Coaching support (recommendations, reflections, next steps)
* Insights & analytics (patterns, trends, progress indicators)
* Automation support (reminders, follow-ups, workflow triggers)

### 2.2 Role-Based Scope

* **Students**: learning help, explanations, motivation, reflection
* **Parents**: summaries, progress insights, alerts, guidance
* **Coaches/Teachers**: planning help, student insights, content drafting
* **Admins**: analytics, configuration insights, operational summaries

All capabilities are gated by **RBAC + audience profile rules**.

---

## 3. Out-of-Scope / Disallowed Capabilities

AI must **never**:

* Make final academic, disciplinary, or medical decisions
* Replace a coach/teacher in evaluation or judgment
* Generate unsafe, age-inappropriate, or harmful content
* Provide legal, medical, or mental health advice
* Act autonomously without explicit user or workflow triggers
* Modify core data directly without backend validation

If a feature requires these behaviors, it must be redesigned or rejected.

---

## 4. Audience Profiles & Experience Rules

AI behavior varies by **audience profile**:

### 4.1 Young Children

* Simple language
* Encouraging, supportive tone
* No open-ended or unsafe topics
* High refusal sensitivity
* Parent/coach visibility by default

### 4.2 Teens

* Guided autonomy
* Clear boundaries
* Explanatory reasoning
* Safety filters still enforced

### 4.3 Adults / Coaches

* Higher depth and flexibility
* Analytical and reflective tone
* Tool-assisted workflows allowed

Audience rules override feature logic and are enforced centrally.

---

## 5. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **AI is assistive, not authoritative**
2. **Explainability over cleverness**
3. **Safety over completeness**
4. **Consistency over novelty**
5. **Human override always available**
6. **Config-driven behavior, not hardcoded logic**

Any AI feature violating these principles must not ship.

---

## 6. Quality Bar (Required for Release)

Every AI feature must meet the following:

### 6.1 Functional Quality

* Correctly scoped to its role and audience
* Produces useful, relevant output ≥ 80% of the time (measured)
* Handles unclear input gracefully

### 6.2 Safety & Trust

* No unsafe content under normal usage
* Clear refusals when boundaries are hit
* No hallucinated facts presented as truth

### 6.3 UX Quality

* Clear loading, error, and fallback states
* Responses readable within expected time (< UX SLA)
* Explicit messaging when AI may be uncertain

### 6.4 Reliability

* Provider failure does not break screens
* Fallback behavior defined
* Kill switch tested

### 6.5 Governance

* Prompt versioned and reviewable
* Feature controllable via Platform Studio
* Logged, auditable, and measurable

---

## 7. Success Metrics

Each AI feature must define:

* Primary success metric (learning outcome, time saved, clarity)
* Safety metrics (refusals, flags)
* Cost metrics (tokens per action)
* User satisfaction signals

Features without measurable outcomes should not ship.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

AI is **not** intended to:

* Be a general-purpose chatbot
* Replace structured curriculum
* Remove human accountability
* Introduce hidden automation

---

## 9. Enforcement

* Platform Studio enforces enable/disable per tenant and role
* Gateway enforces scope, policies, and audience rules
* Violations trigger rollback or kill switch

This guide is foundational and must be read before designing, implementing, or approving any AI or automation feature.
