# Audience Profiles & Experiences (Kid / Teen / Adult / Coaching)

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines **audience profiles** and how AI, automation, tools, tone, UX, and permissions must adapt for each group. It ensures the platform delivers **age-appropriate, role-aware, safe, and effective experiences** while reusing the same underlying AI and automation architecture.

This document is mandatory for all AI features, widgets, automations, MCP tools, and connectors.

---

## 2. Audience Profiles Overview

Audience profiles are **orthogonal to roles** (student, parent, coach, admin) and are resolved at runtime.

| Profile  | Typical Users      | Risk Level | Autonomy  |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Kid      | Young students     | High       | Very Low  |
| Teen     | Older students     | Medium     | Medium    |
| Adult    | Parents / learners | Low        | High      |
| Coaching | Teachers / coaches | Low        | Very High |

Audience profile rules always **override feature logic**.

## 5. Enforcement Points

Audience rules are enforced at:

* Platform Studio (config validation)
* AI & Automation Gateway (runtime checks)
* Widget rendering layer (UX constraints)

Violations trigger:

* Feature disable
* Safe fallback
* Audit event

---

## 6. Design & Implementation Rules

* Audience profile must be resolved before AI execution
* Prompt templates must be profile-specific
* Tool access must be profile-gated
* Automations must respect autonomy level

---

## 7. Metrics & Validation

Each profile must track:

* Safety flags per 1k interactions
* Refusal rates
* User satisfaction
* Escalation frequency

---

## 8. Non-Negotiables

* No single AI behavior fits all audiences
* Kids are always safety-first
* Coaches retain human accountability
* Profiles cannot be overridden at runtime by AI

---

This guide ensures AI experiences are **responsible, adaptive, and aligned** with the platform’s educational and trust goals.
