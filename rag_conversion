I am creating a rag system for my coaching app , lets say a coaching which has physicc chemistry and maths as subjects for 11 class what should be my prodecutre i an using n8n

20 Dec
I'll help you design a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for your coaching app in n8n. Here's a comprehensive procedure tailored for Class 11 Physics, Chemistry, and Maths:

Overall Architecture
Your RAG system will need these key components:

Document ingestion and chunking
Vector database for embeddings
Retrieval mechanism
LLM integration for response generation
Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Document Preparation & Organization

First, organize your content:

Structure files by Subject → Topic → Subtopic
Use consistent formats (PDF, markdown, or text files)
Include formulas, diagrams descriptions, and solved examples
Tag content with metadata (subject, chapter, difficulty level, exam type)
2. Set Up Vector Database

Choose a vector database (I'd recommend Pinecone, Qdrant, or Supabase with pgvector):

Create separate namespaces/collections for each subject
This allows subject-specific filtering during retrieval
3. Build the Ingestion Workflow in n8n

Create a workflow with these nodes:

Trigger: Manual/Schedule/Webhook for uploading documents
Read Files: Use "Read Binary Files" node
Extract Text: Use "Extract from File" node or PDF parser
Text Splitter: Break content into chunks (500-1000 tokens with 100-200 overlap)
Add Metadata: Inject subject, chapter, topic tags
Generate Embeddings: Use OpenAI Embeddings or alternatives (text-embedding-3-small)
Store in Vector DB: Insert embeddings with metadata
4. Build the Query Workflow

This handles student questions:

Webhook/Chat Trigger: Receives student query
Query Classification: Identify subject (Physics/Chemistry/Maths) using simple LLM call
Generate Query Embedding: Convert question to vector
Vector Search: Retrieve top 3-5 relevant chunks (filter by subject if needed)
Context Assembly: Combine retrieved chunks
LLM Generation: Use Claude/GPT with this prompt structure:
  Context from textbook: {retrieved_chunks}
  Student question: {query}
  Provide a clear explanation suitable for Class 11 students.
Response Formatting: Structure the answer appropriately
Return to User: Send response back
5. Important Considerations for Academic Content

Formula Handling: Store LaTeX formulas separately, ensure they're preserved
Diagram References: Include descriptions or references to visual aids
Example Problems: Keep complete problem-solution pairs together during chunking
Cross-references: Maintain links between related concepts across chapters
Difficulty Levels: Tag content as basic/intermediate/advanced for personalized learning
6. Metadata Schema Example

json
{
  "subject": "Physics",
  "chapter": "Laws of Motion",
  "topic": "Newton's Second Law",
  "content_type": "theory|example|formula|practice",
  "difficulty": "basic|intermediate|advanced",
  "exam_relevance": "JEE|NEET|Board"
}
7. Optimization Tips

Use hybrid search (keyword + vector) for better formula/term matching
Implement query rewriting to handle student's informal language
Add a feedback loop to improve retrieval over time
Cache common questions to reduce API costs
Set up monitoring for failed queries
8. Testing Strategy

Create a test set of 50-100 questions per subject
Verify correct subject classification
Check if retrieved context is relevant
Ensure answers are pedagogically sound
Test edge cases (multi-step problems, cross-chapter questions)
Would you like me to help you set up any specific part of this workflow in n8n, or would you like more details on any particular component?

From where i can see the book, should i donwload them and then upload or how?

20 Dec
Great question! Here are your options for sourcing Class 11 textbooks for your RAG system:

Legal & Recommended Sources
1. NCERT Textbooks (Best Option - Free & Legal)

Visit: https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php
Download official NCERT PDFs for Class 11:
Physics Part 1 & 2
Chemistry Part 1 & 2
Mathematics
These are completely free and legal to use
You can download PDFs directly and upload to your n8n workflow
2. Reference Books (If You Own Them)

Scan or use digital versions of books you've legally purchased
Popular ones: HC Verma (Physics), RD Sharma (Maths), OP Tandon (Chemistry)
Important: Ensure you have rights to digitize and use them
3. Create Your Own Content

Write original explanations and examples
Compile from your coaching notes
This gives you full control and no copyright issues
Workflow for Getting Books into Your System
Option A: Direct PDF Upload (Recommended)

Download NCERT PDFs from official website
Store them in a folder accessible to n8n
Use n8n's "Read Binary Files" node to process them
Extract text using "Extract from File" node
Option B: Pre-process Before Upload

Download PDFs
Convert to text/markdown using tools like:
Adobe Acrobat
Online PDF to text converters
Python scripts (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
Clean and structure the content
Upload structured files to n8n
Option C: OCR for Scanned Books If you have scanned/image-based PDFs:

Use OCR tools (Tesseract, Adobe Acrobat, or online services)
Convert to searchable text
Then proceed with normal workflow
My Recommendation
Start with NCERT textbooks:

Go to https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php
Select "Class XI"
Download PDFs for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics
Store them in a dedicated folder
Point your n8n workflow to this folder
Why NCERT?

Completely legal and free
Covers core syllabus
Standard reference for Indian education boards
High-quality, verified content
Important Legal Note
Be cautious about copyright:

Don't upload copyrighted commercial textbooks without permission
NCERT is government-published and freely distributable
If using reference books, ensure you have proper licensing for digital distribution
Creating your own content avoids all copyright issues
Would you like help setting up the n8n workflow to process the NCERT PDFs once you download them?


Do we require ai in between ? For it is one time setup this it is free?

20 Dec
Great question! Let me clarify the costs involved:

AI/Embeddings Cost Breakdown
Yes, you need AI - but costs depend on usage:

One-Time Setup Costs (Document Processing)
Embedding Generation (Processing your textbooks):

You need to convert text chunks into embeddings (vectors)
This is a one-time cost per document
Example with OpenAI:
NCERT Class 11 (all 3 subjects) ≈ 500-1000 pages
After chunking ≈ 2,000-5,000 chunks
Using text-embedding-3-small: $0.02 per 1M tokens
Total one-time cost: ~$0.50-$2 (very cheap!)
Alternative - Free Embedding Options:

Use open-source models locally (free but slower):
Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
Run on your own server
Cost: $0 (just computational resources)
Ongoing Costs (When Students Ask Questions)
Per Query Costs:

Embedding the student's question: ~$0.00001 per query (negligible)
LLM for generating answers: This is where main costs are
OpenAI GPT-4: ~$0.01-0.03 per answer
OpenAI GPT-3.5: ~$0.001-0.003 per answer
Claude Haiku: ~$0.001-0.005 per answer
For 1,000 student queries/month: $1-$30 depending on model
Vector Database Storage:
Pinecone free tier: 1 index, limited storage (may be enough)
Qdrant Cloud: Free tier available
Self-hosted: Free
Cost: $0-$20/month
Free Options Available
Completely Free Setup (If You Want Zero Cost):

Embeddings: Use Sentence-Transformers locally
Vector DB: Use Qdrant self-hosted or Chroma (runs locally)
LLM: Use Ollama with open models (Llama, Mistral) locally
n8n: Self-host (free, open-source)
Trade-off: Requires your own server/computer to run, slower responses, lower quality answers

My Recommendation for Coaching App
Hybrid Approach (Best Value):

One-time setup: Use OpenAI embeddings (~$1-2 total) - do once, use forever
Storage: Start with free tier of Pinecone/Qdrant
Per query: Use GPT-3.5-turbo or Claude Haiku (~$0.001/query)
Estimated cost: $5-20/month for 1,000-5,000 student queries
Is It Worth It?
If you're running a coaching business:

Students expect quality answers
Cost per student query: less than ₹0.10-0.50
Much cheaper than hiring human tutors for 24/7 availability
Can charge students small fee to cover costs
The one-time setup is very cheap (under $5). Ongoing costs scale with usage.

Would you like me to show you how to set up the free/local option, or help you estimate costs based on your expected student usage?

One time setup can take huge money that is find , but can we reduxe running money?

20 Dec
Absolutely! Since you're okay with one-time costs, here's how to minimize ongoing/running costs while maintaining quality:

Strategy: Pay Once, Run Cheap
1. Use Premium Embeddings (One-Time)
Use OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for better quality
Cost: ~$5-10 one-time for all textbooks
This investment improves retrieval accuracy forever
2. Self-Host the LLM (Zero Running Cost)
Best Options:

Option A: Ollama (Easiest)

Run Llama 3.1 (8B or 70B) or Mistral locally
Free, unlimited queries
Quality is good for educational content
Requires: Decent GPU or CPU (can run on laptop)
Option B: vLLM or LM Studio

Host models like Llama, Mistral, or Qwen
Better performance than Ollama
Completely free
Option C: Use Groq API (Almost Free)

Extremely fast inference
Free tier: 14,400 requests/day with Llama models
Running cost: $0 for most coaching apps!
3. Self-Host Vector Database
Qdrant (Recommended):

Docker container on your server
Completely free, unlimited storage
Fast and reliable
Chroma:

Even simpler, runs in-memory or persistent
Perfect for <10M vectors
Free forever
4. Self-Host n8n
Run on your own VPS/server
One-time setup, zero licensing costs
Complete Low-Cost Architecture
One-Time Costs:
├── OpenAI Embeddings (premium quality): $5-10
├── VPS/Server setup: $50-100 (or use existing)
└── Total: ~$60-110

Monthly Running Costs:
├── VPS/Server (4GB RAM, 2 CPU): $5-15/month
├── LLM (self-hosted): $0
├── Vector DB (self-hosted): $0
├── Embeddings for new queries: ~$0.10/month
└── Total: $5-15/month (unlimited queries!)
Recommended Setup
For Best Cost/Performance Balance:

One-time: Use OpenAI embeddings for textbook processing
Running: Use Groq free tier for LLM
14,400 requests/day = ~432,000/month
Llama 3.1 70B quality
$0/month
Fast responses (important for students)
Backup: Self-host Ollama for when Groq limits hit
Vector DB: Self-hosted Qdrant
n8n: Self-hosted
Example n8n Integration with Groq
In your n8n query workflow, replace OpenAI node with HTTP Request:

POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "model": "llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful Class 11 tutor..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "{context}\n\nQuestion: {query}"}
  ]
}
Server Requirements (Minimal)
If using Groq (no local LLM):

2GB RAM, 1 CPU - $5/month VPS
Enough for n8n + Qdrant + thousands of students
If self-hosting LLM:

For Llama 3.1 8B: 8GB RAM minimum
For better performance: 16GB RAM + GPU
VPS cost: $20-40/month
Cost Comparison
Approach	Setup Cost	Monthly Cost	Quality
All Cloud (OpenAI/Pinecone)	$5	$50-200	Excellent
Hybrid (Groq + Self-host)	$60	$5-15	Excellent
Fully Self-hosted	$100	$20-40	Good
All Free (local)	$0	$0	Good
My Strong Recommendation
Use Groq API for LLM:

Free tier is extremely generous (14.4K requests/day)
Fast responses (students won't wait)
Good quality (Llama 3.1 70B)
Zero cost until you hit massive scale
When you grow, paid tier is still cheap ($0.27 per 1M tokens)
This gives you:

High one-time quality (premium embeddings)
Near-zero running costs
Excellent student experience
Room to scale
Would you like help setting up the Groq integration in n8n, or need guidance on server setup for self-hosting?

If i purchase digitaly once can i use then?

20 Dec
Yes, but with important legal considerations:

Digital Purchase Rights
What You CAN Do:

Purchase digital textbooks (e-books) for personal/business use
Use them to train your RAG system
Extract knowledge to answer student questions
This is generally considered fair use for educational purposes
What You CANNOT Do (Usually):

Redistribute the original PDFs to students
Share copyrighted content verbatim (copy-paste entire pages)
Resell the content
Most e-book licenses prohibit commercial redistribution
Safe Approach for Commercial Use
1. NCERT (100% Safe - Recommended)

Free, government-published
No licensing restrictions
Can use commercially without worry
Covers complete Class 11 syllabus
2. If Using Commercial Books (HC Verma, RD Sharma, etc.)

Safe Usage:

Buy digital copies
Use them as reference material for your RAG
Your AI paraphrases and explains concepts (not copying)
Generate original answers based on learned knowledge
This is transformative use - generally acceptable
Risky Usage:

Directly copying text from books
Reproducing diagrams/images
Sharing original content
Legal Framework
Fair Use Doctrine (Indian Copyright Act):

Educational purposes have more protection
Transformative use (RAG generates new explanations)
Not substituting the original book
Small portions for reference
Your RAG system is likely legal because:

Students ask questions → AI generates original answers
Not replacing the textbook (students still need to study)
Knowledge extraction, not content redistribution
Practical Recommendation
Safest Approach:

Primary Content: Use NCERT (free, legal, no issues)
Reference Books: Purchase digital editions of:
HC Verma Physics
RD Sharma Mathematics
OP Tandon Chemistry
Use Them To:
Enhance your RAG knowledge base
Provide better explanations
Include more practice problems
Your AI generates original explanations based on this knowledge
Don't:
Copy-paste entire solutions verbatim
Redistribute PDFs
Reproduce exact diagrams without permission
Example of Safe vs Unsafe
Unsafe:

Student: Solve this problem
AI: [Copies exact solution from HC Verma book]
Safe:

Student: Explain Newton's laws
AI: [Generates explanation using knowledge from multiple sources, 
     in its own words, with original examples]
Additional Protection
Create Original Content:

Mix purchased books with your own coaching notes
Add your own solved examples
Create unique explanations
This makes it clearly transformative
Terms of Service:

Add disclaimer: "Powered by AI, explanations may vary from textbooks"
Encourage students to verify with original books
Position as a "study assistant" not "textbook replacement"
Bottom Line
Yes, you can purchase digital books once and use them, especially if:

You're using them as reference (not redistribution)
Your AI generates original explanations
You're providing educational service
You start with NCERT as the base (100% safe)
Risk Level:

NCERT only: Zero risk ✅
NCERT + purchased reference books (RAG paraphrases): Very low risk ✅
Copying commercial content verbatim: High risk ❌
Would you like help structuring your content ingestion to ensure you're staying on the safe side legally?

Can i convert 100 of books , and is it okay for n8n rag system

20 Dec
Yes, you can convert 100+ books, but there are practical considerations:

Can n8n Handle 100 Books?
Short Answer: Yes, but with some setup

Storage & Processing
Vector Database Capacity:

100 books ≈ 50,000-100,000 pages
After chunking ≈ 200,000-500,000 chunks (vectors)
This is manageable for modern vector databases
Storage Requirements:

Each vector (1536 dimensions) ≈ 6KB
500,000 vectors ≈ 3GB vector storage
Metadata ≈ 500MB-1GB
Total: ~4-5GB (very reasonable)
Vector DB Options for This Scale:

Database	Can Handle 500K Vectors?	Cost
Qdrant (self-hosted)	✅ Yes, easily	Free
Pinecone	✅ Yes (paid tier needed)	~$70/month
Weaviate	✅ Yes	Free (self-host)
Chroma	✅ Yes	Free
Milvus	✅ Yes	Free (self-host)
One-Time Processing Cost
Embedding Generation for 100 Books:

Assuming:

100 books × 500 pages avg = 50,000 pages
~500 tokens per page = 25M tokens total
After chunking with overlap: ~35-40M tokens
Cost with OpenAI:

text-embedding-3-small: $0.02 per 1M tokens
Total: ~$0.70-0.80 ✅ Very cheap!
text-embedding-3-large: $0.13 per 1M tokens
Total: ~$4.50-5.20 (better quality)
Processing Time:

With API rate limits: 2-4 hours for batch processing
Can parallelize with n8n workflows
n8n Limitations & Solutions
Potential Issues:
1. Workflow Timeout:

n8n workflows have execution time limits
Processing 100 books in one workflow will timeout
Solution:

Break into batches (10-20 books per workflow run)
Use n8n's "Split in Batches" node
Schedule multiple workflow runs
2. Memory Limits:

Processing huge PDFs can cause memory issues
Solution:

Process one book at a time
Use streaming/chunking during extraction
Clear memory between books
3. Rate Limits (OpenAI):

API has rate limits on requests/minute
Solution:

Add delays between API calls
Use batch processing endpoints
Spread processing over time
Recommended Architecture for 100 Books
Phase 1: Bulk Processing Workflow
Trigger (Manual/Schedule)
  ↓
Read Book Files (batch of 10)
  ↓
Loop: For Each Book
  ↓
  Extract Text → Split into Chunks → Add Metadata
  ↓
  Generate Embeddings (batch of 100 chunks)
  ↓
  Store in Vector DB
  ↓
Next Book
  ↓
Complete
Phase 2: Smart Retrieval
Challenge: With 100 books, retrieval can be noisy

Solutions:

1. Hierarchical Metadata:

json
{
  "subject": "Physics",
  "class": "11",
  "book_name": "HC Verma Part 1",
  "chapter": "5",
  "topic": "Newton's Laws",
  "difficulty": "advanced",
  "content_type": "theory|example|exercise"
}
2. Two-Stage Retrieval:

First: Filter by subject/topic (narrow down)
Second: Vector search within filtered results
Returns more relevant results
3. Hybrid Search:

Combine keyword search + vector search
Better for formulas, specific terms
Most vector DBs support this
Practical Limitations
Should You Really Use 100 Books?

Consider:

✅ Good Reasons:

Comprehensive coverage (NCERT + reference + practice books)
Multiple explanation styles
Extensive problem banks
Better answer quality
❌ Potential Issues:

More content ≠ better answers (can confuse the AI)
Retrieval becomes harder (noise increases)
Maintenance complexity
Longer processing time
My Recommendation:

Start with 15-25 carefully selected books:

NCERT (3 books - Physics, Chemistry, Maths)
Top 2-3 reference books per subject (~9 books)
Practice problem books (~3 books)
Your coaching notes
Then expand based on:

Student feedback
Missing topics
Quality of answers
Better Approach for 100 Books
Curated Collections:

Instead of dumping 100 books:

Core Collection (15 books):
NCERT + standard references
Use for all queries
Specialized Collections (85 books):
JEE Advanced problems → separate namespace
NEET-specific → separate namespace
Board exam focus → separate namespace
Olympiad level → separate namespace
Smart Routing:
Identify student level/goal
Query only relevant collection
Better, faster, more accurate
Server Requirements for 100 Books
Minimal Setup:

8GB RAM
50GB storage
2-4 CPU cores
Cost: ~$15-25/month VPS
Recommended Setup:

16GB RAM (for comfortable operation)
100GB SSD
4 CPU cores
Cost: ~$30-50/month VPS
Processing Timeline
One-time setup for 100 books:

PDF to text extraction: 5-10 hours (can automate)
Embedding generation: 3-5 hours (with API)
Vector DB insertion: 2-3 hours
Total: 1-2 days (mostly automated, run overnight)
My Strong Recommendation
Start Small, Scale Smart:

Week 1: Process 5 books (NCERT core)

Test the system
Verify quality
Debug issues
Week 2-3: Add 10-15 reference books

Monitor retrieval quality
Adjust chunking/metadata
Week 4+: Gradually add more

Based on actual student needs
Fill gaps you discover
Don't process 100 books blindly - you might waste time on content that's never queried.

Would you like help designing the batch processing workflow in n8n, or guidance on which 15-20 books to prioritize first?

Files hidden in shared chats
For example this is one chapter , what we can do with this

20 Dec
Great! You've uploaded an NCERT Physics Class 11 chapter on "Motion in a Straight Line". Let me show you exactly what you can do with this for your RAG system.

What You Can Do With This Chapter
1. Immediate Processing Steps
Extract & Chunk the Content:

Extract text from the PDF (you already have it)
Break into logical chunks:
By section (2.1 Introduction, 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity, etc.)
By concept (definitions, equations, examples)
Keep examples intact (don't split Example 2.1 across chunks)
Add Rich Metadata:

json
{
  "subject": "Physics",
  "class": "11",
  "chapter": "2",
  "chapter_name": "Motion in a Straight Line",
  "section": "2.2",
  "section_name": "Instantaneous Velocity and Speed",
  "content_type": "theory",
  "concepts": ["velocity", "acceleration", "kinematics"],
  "equations": ["v = dx/dt", "a = dv/dt"],
  "examples": ["2.1", "2.2"]
}
```

### 2. **Specific Chunking Strategy for This Chapter**

**Good Chunks:**
- Introduction section (page 1)
- Each sub-section (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5)
- Each worked example as a complete chunk
- Summary section
- Each exercise problem separately

**Example Chunk:**
```
Chunk ID: physics_11_ch2_example_2.3
Content: "Example 2.3 A ball is thrown vertically upwards..."
[Include complete problem + solution]
Metadata: {
  "type": "solved_example",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "topics": ["free fall", "projectile motion"]
}
```

### 3. **Special Handling for Physics Content**

**Preserve Equations:**
The chapter has many equations:
- `v = v₀ + at`
- `x = v₀t + ½at²`
- `v² = v₀² + 2ax`

Store these with LaTeX format:
```
v = v_0 + at
x = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ax
```

**Handle Graphs/Figures:**
- Extract figure descriptions
- Store as separate metadata: "Fig 2.1: Position-time graph"
- Include caption text in chunks

### 4. **Query Examples Your System Could Answer**

After processing this chapter:

**Student Query:** "What is instantaneous velocity?"
**RAG Response:** Retrieves section 2.2, returns: "The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval Δt becomes infinitesimally small. v = lim(Δt→0) Δx/Δt = dx/dt"

**Student Query:** "Solve a problem on free fall"
**RAG Response:** Retrieves Example 2.4, provides the free fall problem and solution

**Student Query:** "What are the kinematic equations?"
**RAG Response:** Retrieves section 2.4, returns the three equations with explanations

### 5. **n8n Processing Workflow for This Chapter**
```
1. Read PDF → Extract text
2. Split by sections:
   - Use headers (2.1, 2.2, etc.) as split points
   - Keep Examples complete
3. For each chunk:
   - Extract equations (regex for formulas)
   - Identify figures
   - Add metadata
4. Generate embeddings
5. Store in vector DB with metadata
6. Expected Output Structure
From this single chapter, you'll get approximately:

Main sections: 5-6 chunks
Examples: 7 chunks (Examples 2.1 to 2.7)
Summary: 1 chunk
Exercises: 18 chunks (one per exercise)
Total: ~30-35 chunks
7. Metadata Example for This Chapter
json
{
  "book": "NCERT Physics Part 1",
  "class": "11",
  "chapter_number": 2,
  "chapter_title": "Motion in a Straight Line",
  "topics": [
    "kinematics",
    "velocity",
    "acceleration",
    "equations of motion",
    "free fall",
    "graphs"
  ],
  "total_examples": 7,
  "total_exercises": 18,
  "key_equations": [
    "v = v0 + at",
    "x = v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2",
    "v^2 = v0^2 + 2*a*x"
  ]
}
8. Smart Retrieval Benefits
When students ask:

"Equation of motion" → Returns section 2.4
"Free fall example" → Returns Example 2.4
"Graph of motion" → Returns relevant sections with graph descriptions
"Galileo odd numbers" → Returns Example 2.5
9. Next Steps with This File
Option A: Process Just This Chapter (Test)

Extract text (already done)
Manually chunk by sections
Generate embeddings for 5-10 chunks
Test retrieval quality
Refine chunking strategy
Option B: Process All Physics Chapters

Download all NCERT Physics chapters
Apply same processing to all
Build complete Physics knowledge base
10. Code Snippet for Processing
Here's what you'd do in n8n (pseudocode):

javascript
// Read PDF
pdf_text = extract_text(keph102.pdf)

// Split by examples
examples = extract_sections(pdf_text, "Example")

// Split by main sections  
sections = extract_sections(pdf_text, "2.1", "2.2", etc.)

// Add metadata
for each chunk:
  chunk.metadata = {
    subject: "Physics",
    chapter: 2,
    type: identify_type(chunk),
    equations: extract_equations(chunk)
  }

// Generate embeddings
embeddings = openai.embed(chunk.text)

// Store
vector_db.insert(chunk, embeddings, metadata)
My Recommendation
Start with this single chapter:

Manually chunk it into ~10 sections
Process through your n8n workflow
Test with student queries like:
"What is acceleration?"
"Explain velocity-time graphs"
"Give me a free fall problem"
See if retrieval works well
Adjust chunking/metadata based on results
This will help you perfect the process before scaling to 100 books!

Would you like help setting up the n8n workflow to process this specific chapter, or should we discuss the chunking strategy in more detail?
