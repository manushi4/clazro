# AI Permissions, Consent & RBAC

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines **who can access AI**, **what AI can do on their behalf**, and **what data and tools AI may use**, enforced through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **explicit consent**.

It ensures AI features are:

* permissioned (no implicit access)
* auditable (who allowed what, when)
* safe for minors
* tenant-controlled

This guide applies to **all AI features, automations, MCP/tool calls, and external connectors**.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No permission → no AI**
2. **Consent is explicit, revocable, and versioned**
3. **Roles define authority; profiles define safety**
4. **Children never grant consent alone**
5. **Tools and automations require separate permission**
6. **Permissions are enforced centrally (Gateway)**

---

## 3. Roles vs Audience Profiles

* **Roles** define *authority* (what actions are allowed)
* **Audience profiles** define *safety constraints* (how AI behaves)

| Concept | Examples                      | Purpose           |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Role    | Student, Parent, Coach, Admin | Permission scope  |
| Profile | Kid, Teen, Adult, Coaching    | Safety & UX rules |

Both must pass validation for any AI request.

## 4. RBAC Model for AI

### 4.1 Core Roles

#### Student

* AI access: limited
* Tool access: ❌
* Automation: ❌ (read-only insights only)

#### Parent

* AI access: summaries, insights
* Tool access: limited (calendar, notifications)
* Automation: ✅ (approval-based)

#### Coach / Teacher

* AI access: full coaching tools
* Tool access: ✅ (approved tools)
* Automation: ✅ (multi-step workflows)

#### Admin

* AI access: analytics, configuration insights
* Tool access: limited to ops tools
* Automation: platform-level workflows

---

### 4.2 Permission Categories

Permissions are granted per **feature**, not globally:

* AI_CHAT_USE
* AI_SUMMARIZE
* AI_INSIGHTS
* AI_COPILOT
* AI_AUTOMATION_TRIGGER
* AI_TOOL_USE
* AI_CONFIG_MANAGE

Each permission is evaluated at runtime.

---

## 5. Consent Model

### 5.1 Consent Types

* **AI Usage Consent** – allows AI to process data
* **Data Processing Consent** – allows specific data categories
* **Tool/Connector Consent** – allows external integrations
* **Automation Consent** – allows background actions

Each consent has:

* scope
* version
* timestamp
* grantedBy

---

### 5.2 Consent Rules by Audience

#### Children (<13)

* Consent must be granted by parent/guardian
* Consent required per feature category
* Consent is revocable at any time

#### Teens (13–17)

* Shared consent model
* Parent visibility required

#### Adults

* Self-consent

---

## 6. Tool & Automation Permissions

### 6.1 Tool Permissions

Tool use requires **all** of:

* AI feature permission
* Tool-specific permission
* Valid OAuth scope
* Audience profile allowance

Tools are allowlisted per role and profile.

### 6.2 Automation Permissions

Automations require:

* explicit enablement
* visibility into actions
* approval for sensitive workflows

No silent automation for minors.

---

## 7. Runtime Enforcement (Gateway)

Before any AI execution, the Gateway must validate:

1. Role permission
2. Audience profile allowance
3. Consent validity
4. Tool/automation permission
5. Tenant policy

Failure at any step results in **POLICY_REFUSAL**.

---

## 8. Permission Resolution Order

1. Global safety rules
2. Audience profile rules
3. Tenant restrictions
4. Role permissions
5. Feature-specific permissions
6. Consent checks

All must pass.

---

## 9. Platform Studio Controls

Admins can:

* enable/disable AI features per role
* configure consent requirements
* view consent history
* revoke permissions
* audit AI usage

---

## 10. Audit & Logging

Every AI action must log:

* userId
* role
* audienceProfile
* featureId
* permissions evaluated
* consent version
* outcome
* traceId

Logs are immutable and tenant-scoped.

---

## 11. Revocation & Expiry

* Consent can be revoked instantly
* Permission changes take effect immediately
* Expired consent blocks AI execution

No grace period for revoked consent.

---

## 12. Testing & Validation

Required tests:

* permission denial tests
* consent expiry tests
* cross-role access attempts
* tool misuse attempts

---

## 13. Non-Negotiables Summary

* AI is never implicitly allowed
* Consent is mandatory and auditable
* Children require adult consent
* Tool and automation permissions are separate
* Enforcement is centralized

---

This guide ensures AI remains **permissioned, trustworthy, and legally defensible** across the platform.
