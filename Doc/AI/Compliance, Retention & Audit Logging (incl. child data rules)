# Compliance, Retention & Audit Logging (Including Child Data Rules)

## 1. Purpose

This guide defines Clazro’s requirements for:

* regulatory compliance principles
* data retention and deletion
* audit logging for AI, automations, tools, and connectors
* special protections for minors and child data

It ensures the platform remains **legally defensible, privacy-preserving, and operationally auditable**.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Data minimization by design**
2. **Purpose limitation** (use data only for the feature purpose)
3. **Child data gets the strictest rules**
4. **Retention is explicit and enforced**
5. **Audit logs are immutable and tenant-scoped**
6. **Deletion and consent revocation take effect immediately**

---

## 3. Compliance Alignment (High-Level)

This guide aligns with common privacy and child protection expectations such as:

* child privacy protections (e.g., COPPA-style principles)
* educational privacy expectations (FERPA-style principles)
* general privacy requirements (GDPR-style principles)

Clazro must implement these as **policy and engineering controls**, not just documentation.

## 4. Data Types & Sensitivity Levels

### 4.1 Data Categories

| Category       | Examples                              | Sensitivity |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Operational    | featureId, widgetId, timestamps       | Low         |
| Educational    | lesson topics, progress stats         | Medium      |
| Personal (PII) | name, email, phone                    | High        |
| Sensitive      | mental health cues, abuse disclosures | Very High   |
| Child Data     | any minor-linked content/PII          | Highest     |

Child data includes any data connected to a minor account, even if not overtly personal.

## 5. Retention Policy Requirements

### 5.1 Default Retention Windows (Recommended)

* AI execution metadata (no raw text): 30–180 days
* audit logs (immutable): 1–7 years (tenant configurable)
* tool execution logs (redacted): 90–365 days
* automation run logs: 90–365 days
* safety events: per policy (often longer, strict access)

### 5.2 Child Data Retention (Stricter)

* no retention of raw AI transcripts by default
* only store:

  * moderation outcomes
  * safety event metadata
  * minimal audit evidence
* shorter retention windows unless legally required

### 5.3 Tenant Overrides

Tenants may choose stricter retention but cannot weaken child rules.

---

## 6. Deletion & Right-to-Remove

### 6.1 Deletion Requests

Clazro must support deletion of:

* user account data
* AI histories (if stored)
* connector data references

### 6.2 Deletion Guarantees

* deletion request triggers immediate access revoke
* downstream systems must delete or anonymize
* audit logs remain but must be minimized (no raw content)

### 6.3 Consent Revocation

* revocation blocks future processing immediately
* queued automations referencing revoked data must be canceled

---

## 7. Audit Logging Requirements

### 7.1 What Must Be Audited

* AI executions
* model routing decisions
* prompt and policy versions used
* tool calls (MCP/connectors)
* automation runs and step outcomes
* approvals and reviewer decisions
* config publish/rollback
* safety events and escalations

### 7.2 Audit Log Properties

Audit logs must be:

* immutable (append-only)
* tenant-scoped
* searchable
* access-controlled
* redact sensitive fields

---

## 8. Audit Event Schema (Minimum Fields)

Each event includes:

* auditEventId
* timestamp
* tenantId
* actorId (user/service)
* actorRole
* audienceProfile
* eventType (AI_EXECUTE, TOOL_CALL, WORKFLOW_RUN, APPROVAL, CONFIG_PUBLISH)
* featureId / workflowId
* provider/model (if AI)
* toolId/action (if tool)
* result status (SUCCESS/FAIL/REFUSED)
* traceId
* redaction summary

Do not store raw PII or full transcripts unless explicitly permitted.

---

## 9. Access Control for Audit Data

* only tenant admins and platform admins can view audit logs
* parents can view child activity summaries (limited)
* coaches can view only student-linked events they are assigned to

Sensitive events require elevated permissions.

---

## 10. Child-Specific Compliance Requirements

For minors:

* parent/guardian consent required for AI usage
* parent visibility into AI use
* restricted tool access
* no marketing profiling
* no behavioral advertising logic

---

## 11. Safety Event Handling

Safety events are treated as:

* highly restricted
* minimal retention of raw content
* strong access control

---

## 12. Data Residency & Regional Controls (If Applicable)

If tenants require:

* regional storage restrictions
* region-limited provider routing

Routing and storage must enforce it via tenant policy.

---

## 13. Phase 1 Minimum Implementation

1. audit logging for AI + tools + workflows + approvals
2. retention enforcement jobs
3. deletion and consent revoke enforcement
4. child transcript minimization

---

## 14. Non-Negotiables Summary

* child data handled with highest protection
* retention is enforced, not optional
* audit logs are immutable and redacted
* deletion and consent revocation act immediately

---

This guide ensures Clazro’s AI, tools, and automations remain **compliant, privacy-preserving, and auditable** across tenants and audiences.
